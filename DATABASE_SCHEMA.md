# Project Management System - Database Schema Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive MySQL database schema for the Project Management System. The schema is designed with normalization, lookup tables, soft deletes, and extensibility in mind.

## Database Connection
- **Database Name**: `project_management_system`
- **User**: `root` (no password for local development)
- **Host**: `localhost`
- **Port**: `3306`

## Schema Features
- âœ… **Normalized Design**: Separate tables for users, projects, tasks with proper relationships
- âœ… **Lookup Tables**: Centralized status, priority, department, position, and role management
- âœ… **Soft Deletes**: `is_delete` field in all tables for data preservation
- âœ… **Active/Inactive States**: `is_active` field for enabling/disabling records
- âœ… **Audit Trail**: `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps in all tables
- âœ… **Relationship Tables**: Many-to-many relationships properly normalized
- âœ… **Foreign Key Constraints**: Data integrity enforced at database level

## Usage Examples

### Soft Delete Operations
```sql
-- Soft delete a user
UPDATE users SET is_delete = 1 WHERE id = 1;

-- Restore a soft deleted user
UPDATE users SET is_delete = 0 WHERE id = 1;

-- Get active, non-deleted users
SELECT * FROM users WHERE is_active = 1 AND is_delete = 0;
```

### Status and Priority Queries
```sql
-- Get all active projects with their status and priority
SELECT 
    p.name,
    sl.name as status,
    pl.name as priority
FROM projects p
LEFT JOIN project_status ps ON p.id = ps.project_id AND ps.is_active = 1
LEFT JOIN status_lookup sl ON ps.status_id = sl.id
LEFT JOIN project_priority pp ON p.id = pp.project_id AND pp.is_active = 1
LEFT JOIN priority_lookup pl ON pp.priority_id = pl.id
WHERE p.is_active = 1 AND p.is_delete = 0;
```

### Project Team Members
```sql
-- Get project team members
SELECT 
    p.name as project_name,
    u.username,
    up.first_name,
    up.last_name,
    pm.role
FROM projects p
JOIN project_members pm ON p.id = pm.project_id
JOIN users u ON pm.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN user_profile up ON u.id = up.user_id
WHERE p.is_active = 1 AND p.is_delete = 0
AND pm.is_active = 1 AND pm.is_delete = 0;
```

## Database Setup Instructions

1. **Import the Schema**:
   ```bash
   # Using MySQL command line
   mysql -u root -p < database_setup.sql
   
   # Or import via phpMyAdmin
   ```

2. **Verify Installation**:
   - Access: `http://localhost/project-management-system/test_database_connection.php`
   - This will test the connection and display sample data

3. **Configure CodeIgniter 4**:
   - Database configuration is already set in the `.env` file
   - No additional configuration needed

## Future Extensibility

The schema is designed for easy extension:

1. **New Lookup Tables**: Add new lookup tables following the same pattern
2. **Additional User Fields**: Extend `user_profile` table
3. **Custom Project Types**: Add `project_type_lookup` table
4. **Time Tracking**: Add `time_logs` table for detailed time tracking
5. **File Management**: Extend `task_attachments` for project-level attachments
6. **Notifications**: Add notification tables for system alerts

## Indexes and Performance

All tables include appropriate indexes:
- Primary keys
- Foreign key indexes
- Composite indexes on `is_active` and `is_delete`
- Unique indexes on email and username

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are hashed using PHP's `password_hash()`
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
- Soft deletes preserve audit trail
- Activity logs track all changes

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Database schema created and populated
2. âœ… Sample data inserted
3. âœ… Connection verified
4. ðŸ”„ **Next**: Create CodeIgniter 4 models for each table
5. ðŸ”„ **Next**: Implement authentication system
6. ðŸ”„ **Next**: Build admin dashboard for lookup table management
7. ðŸ”„ **Next**: Create project and task management interfaces
